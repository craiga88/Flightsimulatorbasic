# Simple Pygame Flight Simulator Concept

This is a very basic 2D/pseudo-3D flight simulator concept built using Python and the Pygame library. It demonstrates fundamental concepts like handling input, updating physics (highly simplified), and rendering basic graphics like an artificial horizon and HUD elements.

**This is NOT a full flight simulator.** It lacks many features, including:
*   Real 3D graphics
*   Accurate flight physics and aerodynamics
*   A world/terrain to explore
*   Multiple aircraft or systems simulation
*   Missions, navigation, ATC, weather, etc.

## Features (Simplified)

*   Basic pitch, roll, and throttle control.
*   Simplified physics for speed, altitude, and vertical speed.
*   Visual artificial horizon that responds to pitch and roll.
*   Basic HUD readouts (Speed, Altitude, V/S, Throttle, Pitch, Roll).
*   Stall warning and basic crash detection.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   Pygame (`pip install pygame`)

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <repository-folder-name>
    ```
    (Or download the files manually)
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the main script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Controls

*   **Up/Down Arrows:** Pitch Nose Up/Down
*   **Left/Right Arrows:** Roll Left/Right
*   **Page Up / W:** Increase Throttle
*   **Page Down / S:** Decrease Throttle

## Disclaimer

This code is provided as a conceptual example and starting point. It requires significant development to become a functional flight simulator game.
